## MonkeySpace 2014 Europe CFP Extended

We have extended the [Call for Proposals](http://monkeyspace.org/call) to April 09. If you are interested in speaking at an event and have knowledge in cross-platform and open-source development in .NET/Mono, then we're the conference for you. All speaker levels are encouraged to submit, we had quite a few first time speakers at last years event!

As always, follow us on Twitter at [@MonkeySpaceConf](http://twitter.com/MonkeySpaceConf) or [@MonkeySquareOrg](http://twitter.com/MonkeySquareOrg) to get the latest news.
