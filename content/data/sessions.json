But what happens when you want to add a feature or fix a bug in one of your shared packages and test it out locally with a project that depends on it?\n\nGem, npm and pip all have ways of installing packages in development mode or editable mode. How can we do something similar with NuGet?\n\nIn this talk I will introduce SlimJim, a power tool for creating Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio configurations that let you work on all the projects you're interested in within a single session. SlimJim can streamline your daily workflow, cutting out repetitive tasks and getting out of the way so you can write code.","speakers":[{"id":24,"name":"Chris Eldredge","twitterHandle":"creldredge","bio":"Chris Eldredge is a software developer for The Motley Fool who loves build tools , open source and Guinness.","headshotUrl":"/images/speakers/chris_eldredge.jpg"}],"begins":"2014-06-10T15:00:00.0000000-04:00","ends":"2014-06-10T16:00:00.0000000-04:00","location":"","vimeoId":""},{"id":26,"title":"The Future of C#","abstract":"Project Roslyn is a complete renewal of the C# and Visual Basic compilers, exposing them as full fidelity APIs for everyone to use, and providing a great foundation for evolving the tool experience and the languages themselves.
